Our product and services are:
1) Think how would a visually impaired person might access the broader financial services apart from our currency verifier service, the search for a proper solution for in mobile navigation to the required services would never end until now, think of broader perspectives, digital financial products not only require great time and effort to be built upon but to really help visually impaired person the biggest challenge will not be navigating within app as it is very easy to build using voice control but navigating from home screen to app, this is the elephant in the room and this is the problem we aimed to solve.

2) Our app is essentially an home screen app, which runs directly on the main home screen of users and allow voice based navigation to other apps. In this way instead of just solving the problem for the currency verification we solve this biggest problem of navigating to other apps. In this way we hit two birds with one stone, one of building a platform on which the organizations can build financial applications. One might even think they might need to build 2 android apps but that's not the case, our technology android native and every android app (android version > 10 which it self is 5 years old now) is compatible with our platform and no extra efforts whatsoever will be required by the developers to build application.

3) To solve the currency denomination we utilize the AI CNN based architecture of MobileNetV2 model along with OCR technologies for correct prediction of currency denomination.

4) We don't store any data, this is one of our design principles, we don't store user data and our android platform {navigation from home screen to app} does not require internet, voice capabilities are embedded directly in our platform and does not depend of any external. To protect other apps we only support navigation from the home screen to app screen and does not support in app navigation that is something app issuer needs to do.

The results I would like to highlight are:
1) In all phones having `Android version` greater than 10, we are having smooth transitions from the home screen to the app screen is smooth and without any visible errors on platform. Currently we are testing on the phones having android version less than 10 and are hoping for the smooth transitions there also.

2) Our AI model currently is able to predict the currency denomination with 88.67% accuracy and we are hoping to increase it to be greater than or equal to 98.5% accuracy.

3) We are also currently testing our OCR based technology to correctly identify currency denomination and till now are having satisfactory results.

4) Our voice based service are working properly as expected announcing denominations and taking commands for transitioning to different apps.

5) To enhance the overall security of our platform we have embedded these services {voice transitioning and navigating to apps based on voice command} directly in the platform and hence they won't require internet connectivity.

6) We will require internet connectivity to only verify the currency denominations using our AI and to increasing the security at this level we use concept of anonymous users on our servers where we don't save any data regrading the user on our server and allow them to verify currency notes through our Android platform `Saharti` to verify currency notes without revealing themselves.

7) To also increase the security we only support transitioning from the home screen to the app screen the other apps main home screen thereby reducing the risks and by `no means` and in `no case` will our platform voice control the navigation within the other apps. Therefore people can believe on us as there will never be any instance that `Saharti platform` taking control of navigation within the other apps.

In conclusions we are having great results for our platform.
